1. Get the repo from github
2. Create a new conda environment using the yml file within the installation_envs folder
3. Activate the environment in your conda prompt either within the zhinst_project folder or navigate to it
4. In the conda prompt, run: pip install -e . (the dot is the current directory, -e means that the library is editable)
5. Enjoy!
